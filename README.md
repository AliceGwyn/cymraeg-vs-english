# Background 
We wanted to explore the prevalence of the Welsh language and its relationship to primary education in Wales.

The Welsh language has been historically oppressed, but recent efforts have resulted in Welsh primary schools popping up all over the country, especially in the North and West, and more government and state business being conducted in Welsh.

We were able to show that areas of Wales with significant early education in Welsh have much higher rates of Welsh speaking among the population at large.

# HOW TO RUN
To run this on your own computer, first make sure you have node.js installed on your computer. You can download it at: https://nodejs.org/en Then, open a terminal and type in "npm install proj4" (without quotes) and hit enter. This should install the proj4 library and allow you to run our code.From there, open our project in VisualStudio Code and right click on index.html to open in Live Server. This should bring up our web page. You'll be able to choose to view either the 2011 or 2021 data on the percentages of Welsh speakers using the dropdown menu right under the Welsh flag. The data is shown as a choropleth using LSOAs (Lower Layer Super Output Areas), statistical areas that each have 1000-3000 residents. You can also see markers representing all the primary schools in Wales. You can filter these by instructional medium, as explained to the left of the map.

Alternatively, you can visit (INSERT URL HERE AFTER WE DEPLOY) to view our page.


# Ways we would eventually have improved this project
If we had unlimited time, we would have liked to include more years of data, hopefully spanning several decades. Ideally, we would have liked to include the education data for all schools in Wales, and to have it update for each year we could display. 


# RESOURCES USED
Used ChatGPT for index.html lines 10-25, getting the border around the map area and the map entirely contained within it.
